# Iris-flower-classification

The Iris flower dataset is a dataset contained in the sklearn (scikit learn) library of python language. 

This data sets consists of 3 different types of irisesâ€™ (Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica) petal and sepal length, stored in a 150x4 numpy.ndarray
The rows being the samples and the columns being: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length and Petal Width.
The below plot uses the first two features.
